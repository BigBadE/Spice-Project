Plans:

Water:
- Buggy: Water Need
- Untested: Humidity
  - Untested: Less water loss in high humidity
  - Untested: Water loss increases humidity
  - Untested: Rooms equalize humidity through doors
- Water Reclamation
  - Water can be reclaimed in rooms or outdoors
  - Dew collectors special in low-humidity environments
  - Reclaimers can keep air at a certain humidity
- Water Items
  - Waterskins, flasks, etc.. to store water
    - Higher tiers store more water for less weight
    - Higher tiers leak less water
    - Refilled when drinking automatically
  - Desalinization of lake water, filtering of river water

Fremen:
- Stillsuits drastically reduce water loss
- Greatly reduced worm attraction
- Ideo only: Custom religion

Spice:
- Small passive gain when in spice areas up to a cap
- Addiction
  - Only happens at high levels of tolerance
  - Withdraw is fatal
- Prescience
  - Gives vision, dodge, and research boosts
  - Boosts increase as addiction goes on longer
  - Boosts capped depending on randomly generated "genetics" level
  - Highest level only achievable by nobles from quests/Empire/etc...
- Harvesting
  - Harvested only on special sand in desert tiles
  - Extreme desert tiles have more
  - Fremen get weaker harvesters that rarely draw worms
  - Higher research harvesters are manual and draw worms

Sandworms:
  - Attracted by random events
  - Will kill anything making vibrations
  - Will leave the map after all vibration-making things are dead
  - Drops teeth used in crysknives randomly (Research on how Fremen get teeth)
  - Potential: Fremen can ride worms

Ideology:
  - Far future: custom precepts/memes
